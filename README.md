## Semester 1 2024

The aim of this project was to create a metric to describe the 'Bustling'ness of each SA2 region in New South Wales. The task involved cleaning and loading data of varied types (geospatial, web api) to a Postgresql database through Python. This was then calculated into Z-Scores for each SA2 region in each category, then fitted to a Sigmoid function to produce an overall 'Bustling' score. Analysis and visualisations can be found in the report, process can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.
